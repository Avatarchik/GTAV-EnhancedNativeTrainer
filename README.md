**Current coordination status**:

We are back to normal after a Script Hook update was released to match the new game version, after the 'Ill Gotten Gains' DLC update broke compatibility.

Update 21 was released on June 8.
Update 22 is released to testers.

Pull request processing etc is now back to normal after a holiday.
