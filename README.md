# GTA V Enhanced Native Trainer

GTA V PC Enhanced Native Trainer, building on Alexander Blade's original sample.
Because of the MSXML parser, this project may now require the Windows SDK: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279

The VS project currently expects you to have C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\ and descendents. This may ultimately be unnecessary, I'm not sure.

####Licensing & Distribution

The project license is the GPL, thus you have permission to create your own separate works from this project, and do as you like with them, subject to the license.

However, to reduce the risk of malware inclusion causing damage to this project, we also ask you to comply with this condition: you **must** name & label any derived public projects (i.e. any spinoffs you make and release) as something other than 'Enhanced Native Trainer' or any variation that is likely to cause confusion to users.

Additionally, members and users of **this project** must not make available public releases of this project without permission from the project coordinator(s). Unless they build it themselves, the only trust that users can have in the compiled release is that to date the providers of it have been trustworthy, so please don't help bring that reputation into doubt.
