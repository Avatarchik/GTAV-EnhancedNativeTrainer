However, before doing anything, please familiarise yourself with [our wiki](https://github.com/gtav-ent/GTAV-EnhancedNativeTrainer/wiki).

**This GitHub is now private**, but all the prior contributors should have been added, and new requests will be approved. You now have greater access than you did previously, so you can push directly, but **the fork-and-pull-request way of working is still preferred for big changes**, or things you're not 100% sure about.

Feel free to raise issues or take on existing unassigned issues - please assign them to yourself.

**TL;DR LICENSE REMINDER FOR DEVELOPERS:** You can do [almost anything](https://github.com/gtav-ent/GTAV-EnhancedNativeTrainer/wiki/Licensing-and-Distribution) you like with this code, including trying to sell it and not giving us credit for the work, but if you release something based on it, you need to make your code open source too. That's what the GPL means. If you don't manage to do this, I will come after you in a deeply tedious fashion.
