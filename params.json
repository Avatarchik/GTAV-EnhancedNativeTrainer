{"name":"GTAV-EnhancedNativeTrainer","tagline":"GTA V PC Enhanced Native Trainer","body":"### Welcome to GTAV ENT.\r\nThis project is a trainer for GTAV, based on Alexander Blade's ScriptHook and original example, but by now having considerably extended it.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be a community project and was formerly open source in public view. Unfortunately this created a number of problems, necessitating a private repository. A number of other individuals and groups decided not to respect the minimal restrictions we had, namely that (a) if you fork the project, change the name, and (b) if you use the code, your work must be open source.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is still very much possible to get involved. If you would like to be granted access, please send an email to gtavent@hushmail.com with a quick note about who you are, why you'd like access, what you plan to contribute etc.\r\n\r\nApologies for having to provide this check, which is much more annoying for everyone than an open repository.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
